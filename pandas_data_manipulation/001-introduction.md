# Data manipulations with `Pandas`

One of the main uses of Pandas is for data 'munging'. This refers to stages of data processing in which data 
is manipulated, cleaned, filtered or extracted. Pandas makes data data transformations, such as identifying erroneuos data, filtering the data based on erroneuous values, grouping the data, applying computations to the data relatively easy. 

In this lesson, we will learn about a few of the manipulations that you can perform with `Pandas` for this purpose.

But before we start in on the code, let's hear a bit about your use-cases: 

1. What are the data?

2. What are some questions you would like to answer with these data?

3. How is the data currently stored?
    - One file or multiple files? 
    - Do you have access to these files? 
    - What format are they stored in? 

4. What are considerations you need to apply before analyzing? 
    - Data security
    - Privacy
    - Other ethical concerns: what are the implications of putting data together?
