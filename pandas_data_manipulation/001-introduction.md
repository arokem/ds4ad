One of the main uses of Pandas is for data 'munging'. This refers to stages of data processing in which data 
is manipulated, cleaned, filtered or extracted. Pandas makes data data transformations, such as identifying erroneuos data, filtering the data based on erroneuous values, grouping the data, applying computations to the data relatively easy. 

In this lesson, we will learn about a few of the manipulations that you can perform with `Pandas` for this purpose.
