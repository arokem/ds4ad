TODO

**Bring a use-case**

Tomorrow, tell us about a data use-case that you have in mind for your work: 

1. What is the data?
2. What are some questions you would like to answer with these data?
3. How is the data currently stored?

### Day 3: Data analysis and data visualization

Morning: Extracting statistics from Pandas DataFrames (Ariel)

Afternoon:
